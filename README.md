# Fullstack authentication system

A full-stack dashboard with JWT authentication and job automation.

The frontend is developed using React.js with TypeScript and styled using SCSS, leveraging tools like Zustand for state management and Orval for seamless API integration. Orval consumes an OpenAPI schema from a "/api/docs/openapi" endpoint. And generates a fully typed API client for the frontend, ensuring end-to-end type safety and reducing the risk of mismatches between client and server.

On the backend, the system is built with Node.js and Express, using TypeScript for static type safety and Zod for runtime validation. API schemas are defined using Zod, and @asteasolutions/zod-to-openapi is used to generate an OpenAPI specification directly from the Zod schemas. The OpenAPI schema is then served through a dedicated "/api/docs/openapi" endpoint. MongoDB is used for data persistence, and JWT handles secure authentication mechanisms.
